### **REDDIT POST (r/nonprofit, r/grantseekers):**

```
Title: [Beta Testers Wanted] Grant Genie - The grant platform with AI LOI generator + fiscal sponsor database (free for 3 months)

---

Hey r/nonprofit,

I've been frustrated with existing grant platforms for years:

- Instrumentl is great but costs $179-$899/month (too expensive for small orgs)
- GrantWatch has no smart matching (you scroll through thousands of irrelevant grants)
- Candid Foundation Directory is $133/month and it's just search
- Nobody helps you actually WRITE the grants
- Nobody addresses the fiscal sponsor problem (artists/solopreneurs need fiscal sponsors to apply for 40% more grants)

So I built Grant Genie with features nobody else has:

**What Makes Grant Genie Different:**

1. **AI LOI Generator** - Auto-fill and generate Letters of Intent in minutes (nobody else has this)
2. **265+ Fiscal Sponsor Database** - Direct application links to verified fiscal sponsors (nobody else has this)
3. **Smart Matching** - Answer one questionnaire, get matched with ONLY relevant grants (like Instrumentl but at $29/month instead of $179)
4. **Application Tracker + Deadline Calendar** - Track everything in one place with SMS alerts
5. **All-in-one Platform** - Discovery → LOI writing → Application tracking → Winning

**Beta Tester Benefits:**

- Free 3-month Pro access ($87 value)
- Lifetime 50% discount ($14.50/month forever after beta)
- Direct access to me (the founder) for feedback
- Early access to AI features
- Shape the product roadmap

**Pricing After Beta:**
- Free: 5 matched grants + bonuses
- Pro: $29/month (vs $179+ for Instrumentl)

**Who This Is For:**
- Nonprofits (especially small orgs that can't afford Instrumentl)
- Artists and creatives
- Solopreneurs
- Community organizations
- Anyone who needs fiscal sponsor access

I'm limiting beta to 100 testers to maintain quality and give everyone direct support.

Interested? Comment below or DM me and I'll send you the link.

Happy to answer any questions!

Subject: [Beta] The grant platform with features Instrumentl doesn't have

Hi [First Name],

Quick question: Have you ever been frustrated by grant search platforms?

Maybe you've experienced:
- Instrumentl is too expensive ($179-$899/month)
- GrantWatch has no smart matching (endless scrolling)
- Candid costs $133/month just for search
- Nobody helps you WRITE the grants
- Nobody addresses fiscal sponsor access

I felt the same way. So I built Grant Genie.

**What makes Grant Genie different:**

✅ AI LOI Generator - Save 10+ hours per application (nobody else has this)
✅ 265+ Fiscal Sponsor Database - Unlock 40% more grants (nobody else has this)
✅ Smart Matching - Find relevant grants in minutes (like Instrumentl but at $29/month instead of $179)
✅ Application Tracker + Deadline Calendar with SMS alerts
✅ All-in-one platform (discovery → writing → tracking)

**I'm looking for 100 beta testers.**

Beta testers get:
🎁 Free 3-month Pro access ($87 value)
🎁 Lifetime 50% discount ($14.50/month forever)
🎁 Direct founder access (me!)
🎁 Help shape the product
🎁 Early access to AI features

**This is perfect if you're:**
- A nonprofit tired of expensive platforms
- An artist/solopreneur who needs fiscal sponsor access
- A grant writer who wants to save time with AI LOI generation
- Anyone who wants smart matching at an affordable price

Limited to 100 spots. I'm committed to giving every beta tester direct support.

P.S. After beta, Pro will be $29/month. But beta testers get lifetime 50% discount ($14.50/month forever). That's $1,974 saved over 3 years compared to Instrumentl.
