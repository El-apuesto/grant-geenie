Hi [First Name],

Are you spending 40+ hours a month searching for grants?

📊 Application Tracker + Deadline Calendar - Track everything in one place

P.S. If you're an artist or solopreneur without a fiscal sponsor, the fiscal sponsor directory alone is worth signing up. You can apply for 40% more grants with a fiscal sponsor.
